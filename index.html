        <h1>Introduction to Video Games</h1>
        <p class="btn btn-info"> Video Games have revonlutionized our lives and have been a 
            great source of entertainment. Their are some video games that stand out. 
            In this website I will be showing you the origins of video games, notable video 
            games, how to play video games. The first ever video game was made on a arcade 
            machine, and the game was called Pong. Pong was the start of a flurry of 2d 
            platformer games and retro style games. Then games were revolutionized with 
            console. Playstation, Xbox, Wii, and Nintendo all released games and that was 
            the beginning of our great story. Video games evolved really quickly as new 
            versions of consoles slowly appeared and game franchises gaining popularity. 
            Some of those franchises were Super Mario, Pac-Man, Wii, etc. 
            These evolved and now games are being played on computer's and mobile devices. 
            Most controll on games are through controllers but here are the simple keys for 
            computer gaming. We use arrow keys or the letters W,A,S,D. W lets you move forward, 
            A lets you move to the left, S lets you move backward, D lets you move to the right. There is also the spacebar which is commonly used for jumping. The left and right click are the main points of the game but it really matters what type of game it is to tell you what the left and right click do. Scroll Down for some of the most popular video game franchises and your first shot at gaming! </p>
